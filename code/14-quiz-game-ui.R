# 14-quiz-game-ui.R
# Deck 04: Beyond prompts (Tool calling UI)
# Goal: show tool activity in the app's UI:
#   1. register an "Update Score" tool with a title and icon (tool annotations)
#   2. record each graded answer in a reactive scores table
#   3. show running correct/incorrect tallies in value boxes
